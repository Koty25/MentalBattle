# Welcome

Hello, this is Mental Battle, a TripleX game, where you need to guess 3 numbers that add up to X and multiply to Y.
To start the game simply run one for the executables (RunMe (Easy) or RunMe (Hard)). Optionally you can simply type in your cmd TripleX, if you are in the right folder of course.

To compile the code, use the line underneath.

```
cl .\TripleX.cpp .\Function.cpp -o MindBattle.exe
```
